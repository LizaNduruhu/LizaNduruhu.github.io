   <h1> How to become a model</h1>
    If you want to become a model, here are steps you can take:
    
    <h2>1. Decide what kind of model you want to be</h2>
    As you're considering becoming a model, think about the type of model you want to be. Some individuals choose to work in print, only appearing in print materials like billboards and magazines. Others may do commercial work where their primary purpose is to sell the products with which they're posing. Other types of modeling you may consider pursuing include:
    
    Plus-size modeling
    Hand modeling
    Runway modeling
    Fitness modeling
    Hair modeling
    Eye modeling
    Shoe modeling
    Jewelry modeling
    Fashion modeling
    You can select a specialization to pursue depending on your interests and attributes. For example, if you have symmetrical and expressive eyes, you may want to pursue a career modeling eyewear or eye makeup. Note that some models conform to conventional modeling standards, while others use their unique characteristics to 
    their advantage when applying for jobs.
   <h2> 2. Start practicing at home</h2>
    You can begin practicing for a modeling career immediately. Look for professional models' videos and study how they move and pose. Imitate and learn from these videos. You can craft your runway walk in front of a full-length mirror if you have one.
     Modeling can be a very demanding career, so maintaining a healthy lifestyle and prioritizing exercise can help you stay mentally and physically well.
    
   <h2> 3. Build your work portfolio</h2>
    You can start building your work portfolio by including pictures your friends and family take of you. Have them capture full-body and headshots of you wearing simple makeup against a plain background. This helps an agent or client determine if you're the kind of model they want to hire.
     Look for start-up photographers who might take 
    pictures of you in exchange for permission to use your pictures in their 
    advertising.
    
    As you progress in your career, you can hire a photographer to take professional shots. Ensure you have a good range of pictures in your portfolio showing you in several poses and locations. This shows you to be versatile and able to work within various situations. If you specialize in a certain type of modeling, ensure you have pictures reflecting this career focus.
   <h2> 4. Look for an agent</h2>
    You can try getting clients on your own, but most clients prefer working through a modeling agency, so it's best to look for an agent. When you visit an agency, bring your portfolio and expect to complete an audition. You can also prepare to provide your body statistics, including height, weight, eye color and shoe size.
    While some agencies may prefer professional pictures, your non-professional pictures may be sufficient. If an agency likes what they see, they may pay for you to visit a professional photographer. Ensure you research an agency to verify they are legitimate before signing a contract.
   <h2>5. Take relevant classes</h2>
    Consider attending classes at a local modeling school to teach you about the industry. These courses teach you how to perform at a photo shoot and maintain good health and nutrition. You may also consider attending acting or dance classes to improve relevant skills. Acting classes can help you perform better in a photo shoot where you have to convey a specific mood,
     while dance classes can help you develop poise and good posture.
     <br>
   <h2>6. Look for opportunities to build a reputation</h2>
    To experience greater success as a model, practice self-promotion. Always look for modeling opportunities that potential clients may notice. You could, for example, volunteer at a local fashion show or look for retail outlets that need models to advertise products. You can also ask local hair stylists and makeup artists who may be looking for models on which to practice their skills. Be sure to treat each engagement as a professional job, and have someone be present to
     take pictures of you for your portfolio.
     <br>
    <h2>7. Use social media</h2>
    The internet is a great way to promote yourself since you can post photographs and videos that may reach thousands of people. Through social media, you can build followers and develop a platform. This could interest possible clients who might want your followers to see you wearing or using their products. If you don't already have a professional social media presence, start to build one. Focus particularly on those platforms that emphasize pictures and video.
